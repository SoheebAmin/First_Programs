# For Nostalgia Purposes Only

This folder contains two text-based games that I wrote when I was first learning how to write python programs. They are poorly written but are still being kept so I can have a record the first "long" programs I wrote.

## Arithmetic Game and Random Game

These two are my earliest self-written programs. From when they were first written in early 2019, their current verions have only been updated in two ways:

1. They were originally written for Python 2.7. I've used 2to3 to convert them to version that can run on Python 3.

2. I didn't really appreciate documentation back then. Comments were added throughout.

## Base Converter 1.0

This program was also written early on in my programming career. It is simply converts decimal into any base up to 36, with alphabetical characters representing base 11 - 36 symbols, and no distinction between upper and lowercase.

There are probably dozens of websites that can do the same thing, but I wrote this on my own when I first took a lesson on hexidemical-based addresses, so I think it is worth keeping.
